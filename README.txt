The project comes delivered with the following files:

- The original dataset taken from gov.com.
- An ipynb Jupyter file that produces a cleaned dataset.
- The corresponding cleaned dataset obtained after running the Jupyter file.
- an R-markdown containing the different causal models tried.
- A corresponding HTML file that provides the results of the code of the R-file.
